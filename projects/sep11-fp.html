                <h1>Context</h1>
                <p> This year I am learning Javascript. It is where Html websites can have functional action. Using what I learn about javascript,I will be applying what I have learned into my sep11-freedom
                    project because you need a strong foundation for you to know how to code and find error of why it is not working. For my project, I am making a chatbox using my tool(Firebase) with a challenge
                    and the solution I had to find in order to finish the sep11 project. For example I have to find which tool I want to learn in the early blog, while the later blog will be how I learn it using LOYO
                    (Learn On Your Own).
                </p>

                <h1>Project: Content</h1>
                <p> This blog entry are the proof I have of how I was able to finised my project. In the first blog it explain how and why I choose my tools and then it explain how I learn my tool on my own.
                    These steps allow me to start creating the website and the project I wanted (Chatbox). Each step I took there were challenge I have to face. It is explain in each blog entries.

                <h1> Challenge </h1>
                <p> This project learing firebase was very about hard. The major problem with firebase I had was connection. I was stuck on it for about 1 month looking through my old code of why it wasn't working and I figure out
                    that my old way of connection was downloading firebase into my old storage, so now I didn't remember how to connect it external. The solution was switching from connecting from external to internal.
                    Another problem after finishing connecting was having the right code to make my porject to work. My old preview code didn't work and I had to do it from scratch. I solve thsi problem by watching a lot of vidoe
                    and reviewing differen code to get my final solution. You can check out my process through this <a href="https://github.com/jimingz9380/sep11-freedom-project"> blog</a> link.

                <h1> Takeaway</h1>
                <p> This project made me wanna challenge myself even more bcause even though it is very hard. I would learn and how find more ways to improve my skill in firebase. Overall I think I just need to spend more
                    time and effect in order to make my project even better for sep12(APCSA). Another takeaway is my communication because without the help of other friend and teacher, I wouldn't be able to do all of this.
                    Including how I'm writing this portorlia, so it is very important to have connection and communication.
