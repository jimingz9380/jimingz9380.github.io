                     <h1> Sep10 - Freedom Project </h1>
                     <h3>Context </h3>
                     <p>Firstly I wanna say I am proud of my work, though I found this class very interesting and fairly except long essay such as this one. This was a good expierence from this class because this whole year took the lesson and learn HTML and CSS to code webstie just for the project called "Freedom project". Well what is the freedom project, freedom project is a project that the entire class have to find a field in the world such as business, farming, art, and sport can be affect by technology. It can be hardware and Software meaning apps and physical device. The freedom project I chosed this year was Business. I wanted to use technology to relate business because I have a best friend who wanted to do business, so it made me thought of how to help him. The process to get here was conflict in the World of business, research past and future technology relate to business, brainstorm, tools, wireframe, and lastly website. This allowed spread awareness of how tech have help Business and future tech (innovaion) affect the future</p>

                    <h3> Content </h3>
                    <p> The Way I have did my Freedom project is by creating the website. The reason is because technology have have already influence people live way to much. Everybody can search up something about the world and their guaranteed their somehting for their question. This made me ceated this website to influence people who are curious how technology have affect <a href="jimingz9380.github.io/sep10-freedom-project"> Business</a>. The website will first explain the origin of the field business. Then it will talk about the present software and Hardwarethat have help then. Lastly giving information of a future possible innvotation that might come true. This link will send you to my presentattion slide of how I made this<a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1k8la3z7heJ2faevH6_vIfZxEycCFY-d3IVeAM67fcoA/edit#slide=id.g12d81bd35a3_0_45"> website</a> </p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-lg-6">
                    <h3> Challenge</h3>
                    <p>if you looked at my presentation it will shows you my process, and every process have challenges because in my brainstorm of new innovation that was a chllange I cross. I have to thinks of a good future innovation that would have big impact to the world. The innovation was a body armor that would help body guard save lives because  people only have one life and it is very tragic if someone lose their love one when doing there jobs. Another challenge was me using my tools, to spread awareness, my tools also have this function that allowed user open this website in any device. The problem  was understand the class they have in the code such as <code> class="one columns" class="columns twelves"</code>. This just two challenge out of many that I have.</p>

                    <h3> Takeaway</h3>
                    <p>My biggest Takeaway is communication for this Freedom project because at the end of the year, I have to present this website to judges of how amazing that technology have affect business. This was huge for me because their also some what like a competition that you have to make your presentation good in 1 min and a half. This made me super nervous when talking to the judges. Somehow I made it through and this talk me how to communicate better in like a big presentation, even if I didn't do that well, it was an expierence. </p>
