            <p class="text"> The this project was about "choose your adventure" (cyoa). It is where our idea are coded into this lesson by command line and github. Even though my
            when you go into it you probably think it pretty bad. The reason is because me and my partner did not spend like 1 year on it 7 day a week and 2 hour a day, I would go back and improve if I have time.
            The idea of me and my partner starting from the bottom as a peasant and slowly become a god, but it is only part 1 because then in the future their more content we can add in the future if we want to.
            we got more idea of path you can choose. We had a lot of tough time, due to the fact we choose the harder way of making this project. This will bring us to the problem and solution.
            </p>


            <u><b><h1> Problem and Solution</h1></b></u>
            <p class="text"> When I first though of the project it would came out good, it would made me proud and I still think this is only the start of the coding I have learn so far. The problem I encounter while doing this project was connect my css through all 
            html file. This made wasted a lot of time and learn I should connected through the style.css sheet but at that time I didn't know how to do it so it cause me and my partner time comsumming css edit.
            In addition the path we have was probably over 20+, so it added more edit. Another problem I encounter was connecting the readme.md file to the starting file. The solution we solve this was slowly learning why and how it isn't working
            and asking for help develop the understanding to connect it by trial and error. I also wanna say somehow maybe the link didn't work because of device because \
            I have try the link on my computer, but it doesn't work while my friend tried it on his and work. It made me veyr confuse how and why it doesn't work, the conclusion I thought is it might of took a long time to register.
